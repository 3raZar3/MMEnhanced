Setup notes:

1.) Create two new databases, one for the minimanager (i.e. mmdb) and one for the forum (i.e. phpbb3)
2.) navigate to the SQL folder and source the two SQL files to their proper DBs
3.) navigate to the 'forum/central_config' folder and edit dbconf.php to reflect your server information
4.) make sure your WoW server is running
5.) login to your website @ sitename.com/minimanager/
6.) to access the forums with administrative access use Administrator/administrator
7.) login to the forums as a regular user by using the login information to any account on your game server, 
the forums will automatically add that account as a registered user... if you want one of those accounts to have admin
access in the forums be sure to login as admin and set it accordingly.


future releases will include a CMS-sytel interface for the minimanager and possibly a new armory.
